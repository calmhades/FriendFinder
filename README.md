# FriendFinder

The main goals of this exercise were to become more familiar with:

* Seperating routes from our main javascript file to their own files and linking them togehter using export and require commands.  To get this to work, we needed to turn them into functions in their own files and callback to the function in the files that needed it.

  
* Collecting input from the user to compare an average of similarities between users to find a compatible friend.

* Deployment to Heroku, so the app can be shared beyond the computer we created it on.

The web app allows a user to fill out a questionaire of 10 questions, including their name and a linked photo.  It then processes their answers agains all other user submitted entries to find a match!
